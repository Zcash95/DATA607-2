## DATA 607 LAB 2: SQL & R

This is Lab2 of Data 607 which is the SQL and R lab. I began this lab by asking 5 friends their ratings on 6 different movies. These movies included "Remember the titans",	"Coach Carter",	"Love & Basketball"	,"Goodfellas",	"Black Panther" &	"Joker". I began by going to my workbench and creating a table, the commands are posted on the far bottom. 



## Load Libararies

```{Load Libraries}

library("DBI")
library("dplyr")
library("tidyverse")
library("RMySQL")
```

## Upload Data from MySQL to R Studio 

I exported the dataset from MySQL as a CSV file to my computer and uploaded it to R Studio. This now gives us the ability to clean and transform the data if needed using R tools.

*I honestly had trouble connecting to my database though I had all the proper steps in place. I tried several different things but this didn't work for me so I tried a different method which we had the option of doing. I would like some feedback on what my mistake in this part so I can connect directly in my next data importing task.

This was my input among many others that I tried:
connection <- dbConnect(RMySQL::MySQL(), 
                                                     dbname = "DATA_607_Movie_Ratings",
                                                     host = "127.0.0.1",
                                                     port = 3306, 
                                                     user = "root", 
                                                     password = "YES"

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

file_path <- "DATA607MOVIERATINGS.csv"

Movie_ratings <- read.csv(file_path)
```
## Transforming and exploring the data
We'll now use some R functions to clean and explore the data. We cleaned the data and set it into a table. Upon completing the table we used the average columns function with a line that excludes the N/A. I arrived at "Goodfellas" with the highest average rating of 4.75! 

```{r}

str(Movie_ratings)


Movie_ratings2 <- data.frame(
  column1 = c("Mus", "Ab", "Husein", "Isha", "Moh"),
  column2 = c("4", "4", "5", "NA", "4"),
  column3 = c("5", "5", "4", "4", "5"),
  column4 = c("4", "5", "4", "5", "5"),
  column5 = c("5", "4", "5", "NA", "5"),
  column6 = c("5", "4", "5", "4", "4"),
  column7 = c("5", "5", "4", "4", "5"),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)

names(Movie_ratings2) <- c("Name", "Remember_the_titans", "Coach_Carter", "Love&Basketball", "Goodfellas", "Black_Panther", "Joker")


print(Movie_ratings2)


```

## CORRESPONDING SQL COMMANDS 
Create Table in SQL

CREATE TABLE `Movie Ratings` (
  `Friends Name` varchar(15) NOT NULL,
  `Remember the titans` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Coach Carter` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `Love and Basketball` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `Good Fellas` varchar(45) DEFAULT NULL,
  `Black Panther` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  `Joker` varchar(45) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`Friends Name`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4 COLLATE=utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci;

## Changed table name

ALTER TABLE `DATA 607 Movie Ratings`.`Movie Ratings` 

# Enter Information into table 

INSERT INTO `DATA 607 Movie Ratings`.`Movie Ratings` (`Friends Name`, `Remember the titans`, `Coach Carter`, `Love and Basketball`, `Good Fellas`, `Black Panther`, `Joker`) VALUES ('Mus', '4', '5', '4', '5', '5', '5');

INSERT INTO `DATA 607 Movie Ratings`.`Movie Ratings` (`Friends Name`, `Remember the titans`, `Coach Carter`, `Love and Basketball`, `Good Fellas`, `Black Panther`, `Joker`) VALUES ('Isha', '', '4', '5', 'N/A', '4', '4');
